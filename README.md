# git-browser

Opens a browser to the right URL for a git working directory.

You can add [git aliases](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Git-Aliases) if you want.  Although since both `branch` and `browser` start with `br`, there could be some semantic overlap if you already have aliases for `branch`.

I don't have that issue and have defined these:

```
[alias]
    b = browser
    bs = browser --show
```
